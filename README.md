## Running Your Own Copy

Clone the project and `cd` into its directory. These instructions assume that
you have your `GOPATH` setup correctly.

```sh
# Create an RSA public/private keypair in the current directory for the server
# to use. Don't give it a passphrase.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa

# Download dependencies and compile the project
$ go get && go build

# Run it! You can set PORT to customize the HTTP port it serves on and SSH_PORT
# to customize the SSH port it serves on.
$ ./sshtron
```

## CVE-2016-0777

[CVE-2016-0777](https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt)
revealed two SSH client vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a malicious SSH server. While SSHTron does not exploit
these vulnerabilities, you should still patch your client before you play. SSHTron is open source, but the server
could always be running a modified version of SSHTron that does exploit the vulnerabilities described
in [CVE-2016-0777](https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt).

If you haven't yet patched your SSH client, you can follow
[these instructions](https://www.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/quick%20tip/2016/01/15/fixing-ssh-vulnerability-CVE-2016-0777/) to do so now.
